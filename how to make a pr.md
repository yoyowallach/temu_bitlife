First, identify the branch your changes are on.
If you are alone, use your branch, `Yotam` or `Odelia`. If you are together, use the `Both` branch.
Never EVER use the `main` branch.

Then go to the git menu. Make sure you are signed into your Github Account
At the top, there will be a branch selector, click the branch your code is on and make sure your changes are in the `Review Changes` box.

Write a sumarry of your changes.

**NOTE TO ODELIA**: Write a **DETAILED** summary, dont use abbreviations that i wont know like "miskilik"

Then stage and commit your changes
